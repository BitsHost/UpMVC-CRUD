Building a Simple PHP CRUD Application with JavaScript Confirmation
In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of creating a basic PHP CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. Additionally, we'll integrate a JavaScript confirmation dialog to ensure a user's intent before performing a delete operation.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

A web server (e.g., Apache) installed on your machine.
PHP installed.
Basic knowledge of HTML, PHP, and JavaScript.
Project Structure
Here's the directory structure of our project:


project-root/
|-- public/
|   |-- assets/
|   |   |-- css/
|   |   |   |-- styles.css
|   |   |-- js/
|   |   |   |-- script.js
|-- src/
|   |-- Controllers/
|   |   |-- CrudController.php
|   |-- Models/
|   |   |-- UserModel.php
|   |-- Views/
|   |   |-- BaseView.php
|   |   |-- CrudView.php
|-- .htaccess
|-- composer.json
|-- index.php
|-- data.sql



Step 1: Setting Up the Project
Create the project directory structure as shown above.
Set up your web server to point to the public directory.

Step 2: Creating the Database
Use the provided data.sql file to create a simple users table in your MySQL database. Adjust the database configuration in src/Models/UserModel.php accordingly.

Step 3: Implementing CRUD Operations
Create: Implement the logic for adding a new user in CrudController.php.
Read: Fetch and display users in a paginated manner in CrudController.php and CrudView.php.
Update: Implement the logic for updating user information in CrudController.php.
Delete: Implement the logic for deleting a user in CrudController.php and add a confirmation dialog using JavaScript in script.js.

Step 4: Paginating the User List
In CrudController.php and CrudView.php, add pagination to display a limited number of users per page.

Step 5: Making the Delete Confirmation Specific
In script.js, modify the confirmDeletion function to respond only to buttons with a specific class (e.g., delete-button).

Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully built a PHP CRUD application with JavaScript confirmation for delete operations. This project serves as a foundation that you can extend and enhance based on your specific requirements.

Feel free to customize the application further, add user authentication, and integrate more advanced features to meet the needs of your project.

Happy coding!
